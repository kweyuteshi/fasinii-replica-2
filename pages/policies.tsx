                            </span>The Services are intended solely for guests who meet our age requirements in the location where the vehicle is booked and hosts who are 21 or older. Any use of the Services by anyone that does not meet these age requirements is expressly prohibited.

                            To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account with us (a “Fasinii Account”). You can create a Fasinii Account by providing us your first and last name, email address, and creating a password. When you book a vehicle as a traveler or guest (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself. Similarly, when you list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you provide us with certain additional information about yourself and your vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration, booking, and/or listing process. You must keep your Fasinii Account up to date at all times. Based on information you provide, Fasinii may impose additional requirements for you to book a trip (e.g., providing a deposit, adding a second form of payment, buying a certain level of protection plan, or other requirements). To fight spam and abuse of the Services, Fasinii has implemented reCAPTCHA Enterprise, and your use of reCAPTCHA is subject to a separate Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

                            Where permitted, Fasinii has the right, but not the obligation, to undertake screenings, checks, and engage in processes designed to (1) help verify the identities or check the backgrounds of users, including driving history and driver's license validity and (2) verify vehicle details. Fasinii does not endorse any vehicle, user, or a user's background, or commit to undertake any specific screening process. Fasinii may in its sole discretion use third-party services to verify the information you provide to us and to obtain additional related information and corrections where applicable, and you hereby authorize Fasinii to request, receive, use, and store such information. Fasinii may permit or refuse your request to book or list a vehicle in its sole and absolute discretion. Fasinii may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles shared through the Services. We do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse the safety, roadworthiness, or legal status of any vehicles beyond our policies that require hosts to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads, have a clean title (e.g., non-salvaged/non-branded/non- washed/non-written off), not subject to any applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our eligibility requirements.

When you attempt to book or list a vehicle, or at any time after where Fasinii reasonably believes there may be an increased level of risk associated with your Fasinii Account, you hereby provide Fasinii with written instructions and authorize Fasinii, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, applicable consumer reporting laws, or any similar laws to obtain your personal and/or business auto insurance score, credit report, and/or conduct a background check, including a criminal background check where permissible under applicable law.

You can verify the amount for your trip at checkout before you submit your trip request. Hosts can view earnings on the Host Hub and learn more about earnings breakdown here. When you provide Fasinii a payment method, you authorize Fasinii, or third-party service providers acting on behalf of Fasinii, to store your payment credential for future use in the event you owe Fasinii any money.<br /><br />You authorize Fasinii to use stored payment credentials for balances, including for Trip costs, host fees, and guest fees (e.g., late fees, security deposits, processing fees and claims costs, and related administrative fees). In some cases, our payment processors have arrangements with card networks to automatically update stored payment credentials whenever you receive a new card (e.g., replacing an expired card or one that was reported lost or stolen) and we will rely on such updates to stored payment credentials for balances. Any use of referral travel credit is governed by the terms and conditions outlined here.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Collection of fees </span>Fasinii and its service providers will employ all legal methods available to collect amounts due, including the engagement of collection agencies or legal counsel. Fasinii, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your Fasinii Account to credit bureaus. As a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Fasinii Account may be reflected in your credit report. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees, and/or other third party charges. If you wish to dispute the information Fasinii reported to a credit burea, please contact help@fasinii.com. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your Fasinii Account, you must contact the collection agency directly.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Taxes </span>In certain jurisdictions, Fasinii may enable the collection and remittance of certain taxes from or on behalf of guests or hosts, based on existing and future tax regulations, including marketplace facilitator or car sharing regulations. The amount of taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Fasinii will be visible to, and separately stated, to both guests and hosts on their respective trip related documents and invoices. Where Fasinii is facilitating the collection and remittance of taxes, hosts are not permitted to collect the same taxes on the Services in relation to their vehicle sharing in that jurisdiction.</p></div>

                            <h3 className="text-[#459ED5] text-lg mb-4 underline">Specific terms for guests</h3>
                            <p className="md:text-justify mb-4 flex flex-col">The following sections also apply if you book a vehicle using the Services:
                            <br /><br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Guest commitments </span>
                            As a guest, you commit that you will be a legally licensed driver and provide proof to the host or via the Services of a current, valid driver's license. You will treat the vehicle and any applicable Extras well and will take all reasonable measures to return the vehicle and any applicable Extras on time and in essentially the same condition as received. You will not allow anyone other than a person listed in the trip details as an Approved Driver to drive the vehicle you booked.
                            <br /><br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Guest financial responsibility for physical damage to the vehicle </span>
                            The guest that booked the trip (“primary guest”) is financially responsible for all physical damage to or theft of a booked vehicle that occurs during a trip, plus any additional costs and fees resulting from damage of any kind to the vehicle, regardless of who is found to be at fault. This responsibility applies whether the primary guest has their own auto insurance or not.
                            <br /><br />Primary guests may be insured against damage to the booked vehicle under their own automobile policies. When you book a vehicle on Fasinii, you agree that if any damage occurs to the booked vehicle during the booked trip, you will work with Fasinii to make a claim for coverage under any policy of insurance that applies to the loss.
                            <br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Use of the vehicle  </span>
                            When you book a vehicle on the Services, you must use the vehicle only for your personal use and not for any commercial purposes (e.g. driving other passengers for a fee such as through Uber or Bolt or delivering food or other packages) unless you have express written permission from the Fasinii Legal Department in advance. You may not access a vehicle until the trip start time and you must return the vehicle on time and to the correct location. You must present the host with a current, valid driver's license. You must exercise reasonable care in your use of the vehicle. You are required at all times to operate the vehicle safely, and in compliance with all applicable laws, including without limitation, speed limits and prohibitions on impaired or distracted driving. In the event Fasinii has any concern about your use of a vehicle, Fasinii may terminate your trip at its discretion at any time and require the return of the vehicle, including recovering the vehicle on behalf of the host. You are required to wear seat belts during the operation of the vehicle and to require that all passengers wear seat belts. You are also required to meet any laws or regulations concerning child safety seats and other protections for children. You must not leave the car unlocked or with the keys unsecure (such as in the ignition). You must not engage in any prohibited uses such as:
                            <br /><br />• Making any unapproved alterations, additions, or improvements to any vehicle<br />• Permitting someone who's not an Approved Driver to drive a vehicle booked<br />• Smoking in the car<br />• Fueling a vehicle with an improper type of fuel<br />• Leaving a vehicle unattended while it is running or with the keys in the vehicle<br />• Making fraudulent reports about a vehicle or a host<br />• and any other activity that Fasinii deems as a violation<br /><br />with any vehicle you book through the Services. The prohibited uses list is not meant to be exhaustive. If you have any concerns about your planned use, please contact Fasinii. If you misuse a vehicle, you will be fully financially responsible for any related claims, loss, or damage, and your protection plan may be voided. Guests also acknowledge that using a vehicle in a prohibited manner or otherwise breaching the Agreement may lower available liability coverage to legal minimum limits, or nullify coverage, and may furthermore nullify any comprehensive or collision protection and/or protection plan where allowed by applicable law.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Condition of the vehicle and optional Extras </span>You understand that third parties own the vehicles and Extras offered through the Services. Each host is responsible for complying with all legal requirements (including ensuring the vehicle is registered and insured) and maintaining their vehicle(s) in safe and roadworthy condition. Please complete a visual inspection before you begin your use of the vehicle. If you find damage in your initial inspection, you should message support@fasinii.com at the start of your reservation to ensure you are not held responsible for pre-existing damage. If you find damage on your initial inspection and fail to report it, Fasinii, third-party administrators, or insurance partners, may assume that the damage occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection, you believe that the vehicle is not safe to drive, please do not use the vehicle; instead, please contact the Fasinii team immediately.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> No responsibility for shared vehicles </span>You acknowledge that Fasinii is not responsible and shall not be liable for the safety, roadworthiness, or legal status (e.g., whether the vehicle is legally registered or the subject of a stolen vehicle report) of any vehicles shared via the Services beyond our policies that require hosts to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads, not subject to a missing or stolen vehicle report, have a clean title (e.g., non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not subject to any applicable safety recalls.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Incident reporting </span>You must immediately report any damage to the vehicle you are using to Fasinii at support@fasinii.com or the incident handling number which may be +254 716700697. If there has been a collision, you must also make a report to the police. You will need to use all reasonable efforts to secure evidence from any available witnesses and to provide Fasinii or third-party claims administrators with a written description of the incident and any other information requested, including identity and insurance information of any parties involved in the incident. You are also required to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by Fasinii, third party claims administrators, or insurers. After an incident, you may not continue to use the vehicle unless you have the explicit permission of Fasinii staff. Failure to timely report an incident or cooperate in an investigation may reduce or invalidate any protection plan received via the Services.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Vehicle theft </span>The following conduct may result in the reporting of the vehicle you have booked as stolen to law enforcement, possibly subjecting you and any other driver to arrest, and civil and/or criminal penalties.<br /><br />•  If you fail to return the vehicle you booked at the time and place agreed upon with the host and/or designated in your reservation<br />•  If you do not return the vehicle by the end of the reservation period.<br />•  If the vehicle is returned to any place other than the return location on the reservation or agreed upon with the host. Any damage to, or loss or theft of, a vehicle occurring prior to the host inspecting the vehicle upon return at the end of the reservation is the guest's responsibility<br />•  If you misrepresent facts to the host pertaining to booking, use, or operation of vehicle<br />•  If the vehicle's interior components are stolen or damaged or the vehicle itself is stolen or damaged when the vehicle is left unlocked or running or unattended with the keys not secured during reservation period<br />•  If you fail or refuse to communicate in good faith with the host, police, Fasinii, or other authorities with a full report of any accident or vandalism involving the vehicle or otherwise fail to cooperate in the investigation of any accident or vandalism<br />•  If the vehicle is operated by anyone who has given a fictitious name, false address, or a false or invalid driver's license, whose driver's license becomes invalid during the reservation period, who has obtained the keys without permission of the host, or who misrepresents or withholds facts to/from the host or Fasinii material to the booking, use, or operation of vehicle<br /><br />The primary guest who books the reservation is responsible for any private investigation costs Fasinii deems necessary to recover a vehicle that is not returned. In addition, a KSH 55,000 case administration fee will be imposed on the primary guest if Fasinii and/or the host has to report a vehicle as stolen to law enforcement due to it not being returned.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Repossession </span>Fasinii, a hired agent of Fasinii, or the host may repossess any vehicle booked through the Services without demand, at the guest's expense, if the vehicle is not returned by the end of the reservation, is found illegally parked, apparently abandoned, or used in violation of applicable law or these Terms.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Missing Vehicles </span>If a vehicle you have booked through the Services goes missing and/or is stolen during the reservation period (or extension period), you must immediately return the original ignition key to the host, file a police report immediately after discovering the vehicle is missing or stolen, but in no event more than 6 hours after discovering it has gone missing, and cooperate fully with the host, law enforcement, Fasinii, and other authorities in all matters related to the investigation

                            <p className="md:text-justify mb-4 flex flex-col">The following sections also apply if you share your vehicle through the Services:
                            <br /><br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Host commitments </span>
                            As a host, you commit that you will provide a safe and legally registered and insured vehicle, with current license plates, with a clean (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, and in good mechanical condition. You will provide such a vehicle on time but only to a guest who is listed on the Services as an Approved Driver for the trip. Other than what is required for you to verify a guest's driver's license, you will not collect any information or documentation from your guest at check-in, including guest personal auto insurance. You commit that your listings will be complete and accurate and you will honor all representations made in your listings, including honoring the price quoted to a guest. You will not cancel a booking for the purpose of seeking a higher price from a guest. You will not offer any vehicle or optional Extra that you do not yourself own or have authority to share or that may not be shared for compensation pursuant to the terms and conditions of any agreement with a third party, including, but not limited to, a lease or financing agreement. If your vehicle is subject to a lease, loan, or other financing agreement, you must confirm sharing your vehicle on Fasinii does not violate the terms of the contract with the lienholder. You will not offer any Extra that is not safe, clean, and acceptable for the use it is intended. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle report. You will not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a safety recall without first properly addressing the matter subject to the recall. You will not offer a vehicle that is not roadworthy (i.e., not “street legal”) in the location where it is shared and it will not have any illegal modifications to any part of the vehicle. You will remove any firearms or other weapons from your vehicle prior to providing it to a guest. You will repay loans related to your Fasinii business on time and in full.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Information given at registration </span>When you sign up for Fasinii, you will identify passenger vehicle(s) that you want to list for sharing through the Services. Each vehicle must meet the requirements. You may only use the Services in connection with vehicles that you own or otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share for compensation. For damage to a booked vehicle during the booked trip, you will work with Fasinii to make a claim for coverage under any policy of insurance<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Fasinii photography  </span>Fasinii may offer hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their vehicles and/or hosts with their vehicles ("Images"). You alone are responsible for using the Images in connection with your Fasinii listing and you agree that you will cease using the Images if they no longer accurately represent your vehicle. You agree that Fasinii is the sole and exclusive owner - or exclusive licensee, as allowed by applicable law - of all right, title, and interest in all copyrights, trademark rights, and any and all other intellectual property rights, including right of publicity, worldwide, in the Images regardless of whether you include them in your listing, and you shall take no action to challenge or object to the validity of such rights or Fasinii's ownership or registration thereof. You acknowledge that Fasinii may use the Images for advertising, marketing, commercial, and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation. Further, you waive any and all rights to royalties or moral rights you may have in the Images. If you use the Fasinii photography program, you agree that you will not use the Images in connection with sharing your vehicle on any platform, website, or application other than Fasinii. At Fasinii's request, you will execute documents and take such further acts as Fasinii may reasonably request to assist Fasinii to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protection in the Images.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Vehicle availability </span>Once a trip is booked, you must make the vehicle available or deliver the vehicle as expected by the guest. If you offer the guest the option to pick up your vehicle at a persistent specified location, you must supply the location of the vehicle accurately to Fasinii and ensure that the vehicle is available at that location at the beginning of the reservation period.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Pricing, earnings, and payments </span>You will have the ability to set and revise the vehicle's pricing as you choose. Fasinii will pay you the amount collected from guests that book your vehicle, less the applicable fees payable to Fasinii. A description of fees can be found in the fees and earnings section. To the extent you owe Fasinii or any third party lender money for any reason, Fasinii also reserves the right to deduct those amounts from your earnings payment, debit your bank account, charge any of your payment methods on file, and/or send you an invoice.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Payment Processing </span>In some countries, payment processing services are provided by paystack, PesaPal or Peach Payments and subject to the Paystack Connected Account Agreement, (collectively, the "Payment Terms").<br /><br />• In countries where you receive payment proceeds via Paystack, you agree to be bound by the Paystack Terms, which may be modified from time to time.<br />• In countries where you receive payment proceeds via PesaPal, you agree to be bound by the PesaPal Terms, which may be modified from time to time.<br />• In countries where you receive payment proceeds via Peach Payments, you agree to be bound by the Peach Payment Terms, which may be modified from time to time.<br /><br />As a condition of Fasinii enabling payment processing services through Paystack, Pesapal, Peach Payments, you authorize Fasinii to obtain all necessary access and perform all necessary activity on your Mpesa/ Bank Connected Account to facilitate sharing of your vehicle. You further agree to provide accurate and complete information about you, and authorize Fasinii to share it and transaction information with Paystack Pesapal, Peach Payments, for the purposes of facilitating the payment processing services provided by Paystack Pesapal or Peach Payments,. Fasinii reserves the right to switch payment processing vendors at its discretion.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Airport delivery; personal vehicle sharing regulations </span>Some airports where you offer delivery may take the position that you must have a permit to use airport premises and remit fees. While Fasinii does not believe that rental car permits should apply to peer-to-peer car sharing, not all airport authorities agree with this position.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Maintenance </span>You are required to regularly check your vehicle for any defects in its operations or safety. You promise that, at all times, your vehicle will be in safe and roadworthy condition, in good mechanical condition, and in full compliance with all applicable inspection and registration requirements. You will only list vehicles with a clean, non-salvaged, non-written off, non-washed, and non-branded title. You agree to respond to any applicable recall or similar safety notices and to complete any recommended action before allowing your vehicle to be booked. In addition, if Fasinii believes that your vehicle does not conform to reasonable standards, Fasinii may notify you and reserves the right to remove or decline listing your vehicle until its concerns have been resolved. Fasinii may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles booked through the Services.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Reporting vehicle damage </span>If you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, and you believe that a guest has caused any damage to your vehicle, you are required to report that damage as soon as you become aware of it (and in any event, no more than 12 hours after the scheduled end of the trip) and to provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation of the damage so that it can be eligible for coverage. Based on the investigation, Fasinii or third-party claims administrators will reasonably determine whether the damage occurred during the reservation period and is eligible for coverage. If it was, and you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, you will be reimbursed for the loss as described in the sections below. If Fasinii is not given prompt notice as described in this paragraph, or if you do not provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation by Fasinii or third-party claims administrators, we may not be able to determine the cause. In that case, you agree that we may decline any reimbursement or coverage for such damage.<br /><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Physical damage to your vehicle </span><br /><span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Physical damage reimbursement </span>The protection plans available to hosts address the allocation of financial consequences of physical damage to the vehicle offered by a host during a trip. Physical damage contractual reimbursement from Fasinii applies to your vehicle in the event of a collision and to comprehensive events during the trip, and is subject to terms and exclusions.<br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Actual Cash Value </span>
                            If Fasinii, or third-party claims administrators, choose to pay you the actual cash value for your vehicle, you will be required to do one of the following at the sole discretion of Fasinii as a condition for receiving payment: (1) transfer title to the vehicle, and, if requested, physically deliver the vehicle to Fasinii or a third party appointed by Fasinii to accept title and physical delivery (if applicable); or (2) retain title to the vehicle and accept a reduction of the actual cash value equal to the salvage value of the damaged vehicle based on the highest third-party salvage quote that Fasinii obtains for the vehicle. The standard for determining the actual cash value will be as determined by Fasinii or its third-party claims administrators and in compliance with applicable law.<br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Exclusions to physical damage reimbursement and coverage.  </span>Protection plans selected by hosts on the Services do not apply to:
                            <br /><br />•  Optional extras or personal property, including aftermarket installations (e.g., equipment racks), that are taken from your vehicle or damaged during a trip. Remove all personal property before making your vehicle available for a reservation<br />
                            •  Normal wear and tear to your vehicle<br /><br />
                            If you violate the Agreement, these Terms, or any of our Policies or if you submit inaccurate information about your vehicle when listing it on the Services (for example, falsely represent the make, model, or year of the vehicle), any protection plan you selected will be reevaluated by the services. This protection plan will be reevaluated under the services even if the underlying circumstances are not directly related to the damage or harm at issue. You acknowledge that these provisions are material and that they serve to ensure your compliance. In the event your protection plan is voided, the remainder of the Agreement, these Terms, and Policies remain in effect.<br />
                            <span className="text-[#459ED5] text-base mb-2"> Other host-specific insurance matters.  </span>You will maintain valid and up to date registration information and proof of insurance in any vehicle you share on the Services. You must maintain your own auto insurance policy for any vehicle you list on the Services and such policy must meet any minimum insurance levels required by law. You may need additional insurance coverage, including physical damage coverage, if you share a vehicle subject to a lease or loan. You agree to provide Fasinii with information regarding your auto insurance policy as may be requested and to keep such information up to date. Where not prohibited by law, you hereby appoint Fasinii or a wholly owned subsidiary of Fasinii as your attorney-in-fact for the purpose of filing insurance claims, receiving insurance payment, otherwise administering an applicable insurance policy, and/or working with law enforcement, guests, or private entities to recover your vehicle, as necessary.
